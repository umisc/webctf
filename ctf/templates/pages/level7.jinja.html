    <h1>Level 7</h1>
    <h2>What is a view/controller?</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    So now the developer is editing the code they are copying But they don't seem to know exactly how HTML works. You know for a fact that the view function for the login handler just returns a valid login, no validation. So what's the password?
  </p>

  <p>
    Hint: In MVC, when the user visits a *url* path (or route), they call a *view function* related to that route. This view function can do processing with the HTTP object the client sends. Flask is not MVC but the concepts are pretty general: there are views and each view is associated with a URL.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hint: Try logging in even if you know nothing. If you still don't get it, read the source code.
